                Yes! Totally this- "genuinely making the product the locus of growth".
- firstly, no matter how good your sales team is, they can't sell a shit product that nobody wants
- second, no matter how good your product/tech team is, if they're not thinking about the financials and whether the features are sellable, marketable, profitable, and sustainable then you'd be better off without them and not spending time+money building unthought through, unresearched, unvalidated ideas.
- so making the product the locus of growth ensures everyone is thinking about the bigger picture and not operating in a vacuum where the broader logic goes out the window.

The broader logic for me in the early days is ROI and opportunity-cost. And this is why bootstrapping over vc funding is so useful as a forcing function to ensure that you have these (otherwise you just obviously fail by running out of money). Of course having a boat load of cash is really handy as well. Anyway...

Some potholes on actually running a product team like this, now with the above context...
- in the early days with hardly any users, you just can't test anything unless it has a massive impact. This video is well worth a watch (or 10, i've rewatched many times, specifically the first 30mins). Every startup i've worked at so far invested loads in AB testing and it was worse than pointless (worse because of money spent on hires and time spent on building extra tech to do the testing and analyse data, but also worse because it gives you noisy signals that encourage you to do random or wrong things). The ROI on this is obviously awful but companies feel that they have to have some data team and AB testing going on otherwise they're not doing it right. Of the 20 or so AB tests I've personally run, I've only seen 1 with a statistically significant result and it was because we ran an entirely different website/checkout experience side-by-side and one was clearly better (30% uplift in conversion rate).
- the product folk don't know the business/domain/financials nearly as well as the founder, and are therefore likely to come up with ideas that just don't make sense in the bigger picture of ROI or company strategy. So you've hired a "specialist" who understands how to pull various levers to increase metrics etc. but they're looking at the wrong metrics. Anyway if it is the early days then you don't need a specialist because the levers you should be pulling should be really big obvious ones like doubling the pricing (as Jason talks about in the video)
- even if these teams factor in their costs (as the article very fleetingly does) the counter-factual ie opportunity cost is never factored in. So in the example in the article, the team costs $2.4m and earns $5m for the company; firstly it's a nice idea that a team in a massive company could so easily draw conclusions about their own impact when so many concurrent factors are at play (seasonality, marketing campaigns, the movement of the economy etc); but the counterfactual ie opportunity cost is what that $2.4m investment in the team versus what would have happened if I spent $2.4m on something else - let's say I put it into our most effective marketing campaign of the year (to exaggerate the point) - maybe that would have given me $10m ROI and on top of that I don't have to manage 5 headcount either. So yeah, great ROI for this team, but everyone in your company should be giving you good ROI otherwise your company obviously wouldn't survive. The question is how good is that ROI versus investment in something else?
- her suggestion of having a team per concern eg acquisition and retention being different teams ensures that the bigger picture isn't seen by either team and that when one is improved the other is likely to suffer; these teams can only be separated around different products or domains that do not affect each other. It's especially uncomfortable when these teams are vying for the same resources (eg engineers or budgets) and essentially competing with each other in company politics etc. So if you do have a product team they absolutely have to work as one. Better yet, don't have a product team that is separate, and give everyone the skills to understand that all their work should have some measurable impact and get everyone obsessing about this. This is a complex area where some teams will naturally have much longer timeframes to expect returns in but it's a great angle for everyone to have on the work they are prioritising.
- AB testing (or similar) is an optimisation technique, not for exploration anyway. This tweet sums it up quite well, pasted here:

"I think the mistake the industry has made is (and I had to learn this as well), that "we observed ab tests work really well" is really a statement that should read "the majority of the changes we make are characterized as hill-climbing growth of a post-PMF b2c product and ab tests work really well for that". Take any condition out of that statement and it becomes false"

If I translate into my words- AB testing is a tool to eek out percentages when optimising an experience once you have product-market fit (ie you know the tool isn't going to change drastically and you have many thousands/millions of visits per day). It is a complete waste of time when you have tens of users per day and actually you should be exploring offering your customers something massively different that will obviously have a big effect (or not) so doesn't need surgical data analysis etc.

When I've seen a great product "team" it was literally one exceptionally smart person who picked up the phone/contacted hundreds of users and collated all their issues with the product/subscription service and then we made some big bets that made an obvious and material difference to conversion and retention based on somewhat common-sense theories of how customers interact with the product. 

So I'm actually so onboard with you going with your instincts and not testing stuff. You have so much experience in the industry and have spoken with parents and schools to the point where you know how they think and what their problems are - this is so much more valuable than random testing until you have thousands of people coming to the site everyday. And why a product team is an anti-pattern for me until the company is pretty big. And I'd argue anyway that it is better to stay small for as long as poss instead, and try to disseminate these skills amongst people as opposed to hiring specialists who are the only people who "understand the product properly".

Sorry ended up being a massive long email lol.
